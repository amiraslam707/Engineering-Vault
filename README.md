# 🚀 Engineering Journey | 5th Semester CS Student

### 🎯 Current Focus: Backend Engineering (FastAPI & Python)
I am currently documenting my university courses and backend development 
practice to build a solid foundation for a transition into **Data Engineering**.

### 🛠 Tech Stack in Progress
- **Languages:** Python (Primary), SQL
- **Frameworks:** FastAPI
- **Tools:** Git, Jupyter, VS Code
- **Goals:** 1 Year Backend Exp -> Data Engineering -> Masters in Germany/EU

### 📂 Repository Structure
- `01-FastAPI-Backend`: API design, Pydantic, and Asynchronous programming.
- `02-Data-Engineering-Path`: ETL processes and SQL optimization.
- `03-DSA-Practice`: Algorithmic problem solving.
- `04-University-Semester-5`: Core CS academics.
